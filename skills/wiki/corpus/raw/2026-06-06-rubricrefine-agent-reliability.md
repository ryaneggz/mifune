  <meta name="description" content="Standard AI agents learn through trial and error, but in defense, first-time errors are unacceptable. Lives may be at stake. 

In a new paper, Anduril engineers introduce a pre-execution reliability layer that verifies and repairs agent decision before any execution occurs. Initial testing shows rubric-based refinement allows small, open-source models with only one attempt to match the accuracy of frontier models with up to five attempts. This unlocks the user's ability to interpret the reliability of an agent's action plan through an evaluation of the rubric. The agent autonomously increases the reliability of the action plan by iteratively improving upon the feedback provided by the rubric evaluation.

Without research, we can't solve the hardest problems in defense. Read the full paper on arXiv: https://lnkd.in/gmtbQDG5 | 21 comments on LinkedIn">

In a new paper, Anduril engineers introduce a pre-execution reliability layer that verifies and repairs agent decision before any execution occurs. Initial testing shows rubric-based refinement allows small, open-source models with only one attempt to match the accuracy of frontier models with up to five attempts. This unlocks the user's ability to interpret the reliability of an agent's action plan through an evaluation of the rubric. The agent autonomously increases the reliability of the action plan by iteratively improving upon the feedback provided by the rubric evaluation.

Without research, we can't solve the hardest problems in defense.

If you have enough time (or compute), you can always simulate and even run hardware-in-the-loop tests before doing anything that could cause bigger problems. Something like: Tests =&gt; Simulation =&gt; HIL =&gt; Full hardware with an extra safety layer / harness =&gt; Full hardware tests =&gt; Real deployment.</p>

         comment__text babybear:mt-0.5" dir="ltr">Governance baked in at design beats governance bolted on after the fact every time. A pre-reliability layer that catches and repairs decisions before they execute is exactly what responsible AI architecture looks like. The industry keeps learning the hard way that retrofitting guardrails onto deployed systems is expensive, slow, and often incomplete. Building verification into the decision loop from the start is the standard worth setting.</p>

         comment__text babybear:mt-0.5" dir="ltr">The paper: "RubricRefine improves pre-execution reliability, but it does not eliminate all sources of failure."
 
The post: "First-time errors are unacceptable. Lives may be at stake."
 
That is not research translation. It is a category error.
 
RubricRefine adds six unattested trust anchors — registry, documentation, rubric generation, verifier, prompt integrity, candidate-to-execution binding — then produces a scalar legitimacy signal against them. A compromised input at any point yields a confident, institutionalized wrong answer. The rubric fails closed in the adversary's favor.
 
The gap is attestation. What proves the registry was canonical, the verifier unmodified, and the artifact that scored 10/10 was the artifact that executed?
 
The authors documented this boundary. The LinkedIn team crossed it.</p>

They had to be generated from the thing being checked. That feels larger than an agent reliability problem. 
We mapped it as a structural case because the pattern looked transferable well beyond AI systems: <a class="link" href="https://stratoatlas.com/cases/case-a-ai-2026-101.html?trk=public_post_comment-text" target="_self" rel="nofollow" data-tracking-control-name="public_post_comment-text" data-tracking-will-navigate>https://stratoatlas.com/cases/case-a-ai-2026-101.html</a>

The challenge begins when that decision enters an operational environment.

Validation, authority, escalation, and execution consistency often determine reliability more than the model itself.

Execution depends on decision architecture.</p>
