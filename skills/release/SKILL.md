# Release

Automates the CalVer release procedure defined in `.claude/skills/git/SKILL.md` (§ Releases).

This skill exists for the parts that are tedious to run by hand: version auto-increment, CI polling, and post-release verification. Conventions (branch names, commit format, pre-flight checks) live in the rule — read it first.

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Resolve repo + version

```bash
# Resolve the canonical remote: prefer 'upstream' (fork layout where origin is
# a private fork), else 'origin' (standard single-remote layout). All release
# pushes target $REMOTE so a release never lands on a private fork by accident.
if git remote get-url upstream >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  REMOTE=upstream
else
  REMOTE=origin
fi
REPO=$(gh repo view "$(git remote get-url "$REMOTE")" --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
git fetch "$REMOTE" --tags --quiet                     # version detection needs canonical tags
TODAY=$(date '+%Y.%-m.%-d')

if ! git tag --list "$TODAY" | grep -q .; then
  VERSION="$TODAY"
else
  LAST_N=$(git tag --list "${TODAY}-*" --sort=-v:refname | head -1 | grep -oP '\d+$' || echo "1")
  VERSION="${TODAY}-$((LAST_N + 1))"
fi

echo "Repo: $REPO · Version: $VERSION"
```

### Step 2 — Pre-flight

Follow the pre-flight checklist in `.claude/skills/git/SKILL.md` § Releases (clean tree on the intended source branch).

If `--dry-run`, report version + pre-flight results and **stop here**.

### Step 3 — Promote CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]`

Abort if `## [Unreleased]` has no real entries (only category headers / blank lines):

```bash
UNRELEASED_BODY=$(awk '
  /^## \[Unreleased\]/ { in_block=1; next }
  in_block && (/^## \[/ || /^---$/) { exit }
  in_block { print }
' CHANGELOG.md | grep -vE '^(### |\s*$)')

if [ -z "$UNRELEASED_BODY" ]; then
  echo "Aborting: [Unreleased] is empty — nothing user-visible to release." >&2
  echo "Add changelog entries on this branch (or confirm with the user before continuing)." >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

Promote `[Unreleased]` to `[$VERSION]` and re-seed an empty block above it, then commit on the current branch before cutting the release branch:

```bash
RELEASE_DATE=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')

awk -v ver="$VERSION" -v rdate="$RELEASE_DATE" '
  /^## \[Unreleased\]$/ && !done {
    print "## [Unreleased]"
    print ""
    print "### Added"
    print "### Changed"
    print "### Fixed"
    print "### Removed"
    print "### Deprecated"
    print "### Security"
    print ""
    print "## [" ver "] - " rdate
    done=1
    next
  }
  { print }
' CHANGELOG.md > CHANGELOG.md.tmp && mv CHANGELOG.md.tmp CHANGELOG.md

git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "task: promote CHANGELOG for $VERSION"
```

The `[$VERSION]` section is the source of truth for the GitHub Release body — `release.yml` extracts it via `body_path` (no `generate_release_notes`).

### Step 4 — Promote `development` → `main`, then cut release branch + tag

`development` is the integration branch; `main` is the release line. Push
the promotion commit to `development`, fast-forward `main` to it, then cut
the release branch from `main` (see `.claude/skills/git/SKILL.md` § Releases for
the branch model).

```bash
PREV_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)               # expected: development

# Push the CHANGELOG promotion commit to development.
git push "$REMOTE" "$PREV_BRANCH"

# Promote development → main. main MUST be strictly behind development
# (fast-forwardable). Abort if it has diverged — reconcile manually first.
git fetch "$REMOTE" main "$PREV_BRANCH"
if git merge-base --is-ancestor "$REMOTE/main" "$REMOTE/$PREV_BRANCH"; then
  git push "$REMOTE" "$REMOTE/$PREV_BRANCH:main"       # clean fast-forward
  echo "main fast-forwarded to $PREV_BRANCH"
else
  echo "Aborting: main has diverged from $PREV_BRANCH — reconcile before releasing." >&2
  exit 1
fi

# Cut the release branch from main and tag it.
git checkout -b "release/$VERSION" "$REMOTE/main"
git push "$REMOTE" "release/$VERSION"
git tag "$VERSION" && git push "$REMOTE" "$VERSION"    # triggers release.yml
```

After step 4, `main` and `development` are converged (both at the
promotion commit). No extra back-sync is needed when step 4 was a
fast-forward.

### Step 5 — Poll CI (up to 10 min)

```bash
sleep 10
RUN_ID=$(gh api "repos/$REPO/actions/runs?branch=${VERSION}&per_page=1" \
  --jq '.workflow_runs[0].id')

for i in $(seq 1 40); do
  STATUS=$(gh api "repos/$REPO/actions/runs/$RUN_ID" --jq '.status')
  if [ "$STATUS" = "completed" ]; then
    CONCLUSION=$(gh api "repos/$REPO/actions/runs/$RUN_ID" --jq '.conclusion')
    echo "Release workflow: $CONCLUSION"
    break
  fi
  echo "Still running... ($i/40)"
  sleep 15
done
```

### Step 6 — Verify artifacts

```bash
gh release view "$VERSION" --repo "$REPO"

# GHCR package owner may be an org or a user — try org first, fall back to user.
# Listing needs the read:packages scope; the release.yml docker-push step is the
# authoritative confirmation if the token lacks it.
OWNER=${REPO%%/*}; PKG=${REPO##*/}
gh api "orgs/$OWNER/packages/container/$PKG/versions" \
    --jq '.[0] | {tags: .metadata.container.tags, created: .created_at}' 2>/dev/null \
  || gh api "users/$OWNER/packages/container/$PKG/versions" \
    --jq '.[0] | {tags: .metadata.container.tags, created: .created_at}' 2>/dev/null \
  || echo "(package listing needs read:packages scope — verify via the release.yml run's docker push step)"
```

### Step 7 — Return to previous branch + report

```bash
git checkout "$PREV_BRANCH"
```

```
Release $VERSION complete!

  Repo:     $REPO
  Tag:      $VERSION
  Branch:   release/$VERSION (cut from main)
  main:     fast-forwarded to $VERSION (in sync with development)
  Image:    ghcr.io/$REPO:$VERSION
  Release:  https://github.com/$REPO/releases/tag/$VERSION
  CI:       <pass/fail with run URL>
```

If CI failed, include failure details and suggest fixes.
